What do you notice in the visualization?
Overall I noticed that there is positive trend of number of people coming to india for tourism,as we can see there is a increase the number of tourist visa issued.

What questions do you have about the data?

I do not undestand why specifically tourist visas issued is increasing for United States,Is government of india is encouranging tourism?Can you brief more about that?


What relationships do you notice?

One relationship I specifically noticed is sports like cricket attracting people from bangladesh,uk and srilanka.



What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

Can you make graph  more illustrative,because may be art surgocacy,visitor ,student visas issued may be less but when seeing the graph we may get pattern but it will be good if we can visualize  number of visas issued for these as well.Annual visa approval for different categories
